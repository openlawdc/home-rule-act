except as provided in paragraph (3) [of this subsection], and shall begin at noon on January 2 of the
year following their election.
                 (2) In the case of the first election held for the office of member of the Council after
the effective date of this title [January 2, 1975], not more than two of the at-large members
(excluding the Chairman) shall be nominated by the same political party. Thereafter, a political
party may nominate a number of candidates for the office of at-large member of the Council equal

                 (3) To fill a vacancy in the Office of Chairman, the Board of Elections shall hold a
special election in the District on the Tuesday occurring at least 70 days and not more than 174
days after the date on which such vacancy occurs which the Board of Elections determines, based
on a totality of the circumstances, taking into account, inter alia, cultural and religious holidays
and the administrability of the election, will provide the opportunity for the greatest level of voter
participation. The person elected Chairman to fill a vacancy in the Office of Chairman shall take
office on the day in which the Board of Elections and Ethics [Board of Elections] certifies his
election, and shall serve as Chairman only for the remainder of the term during which such
vacancy occurred. When the Office of Chairman becomes vacant, the Council shall select one of

Board of Elections shall hold a special election in the District on the Tuesday occurring at least 70
days and not more than 174 days after the date on which such vacancy occurs which the Board of
Elections determines, based on a totality of the circumstances, taking into account, inter alia,
cultural and religious holidays and the administrability of the election, will provide the opportunity
for the greatest level of voter participation. The person elected as a member to fill a vacancy on the
Council shall take office on the day on which the Board of Elections and Ethics [Board of
Elections] certifies his election, and shall serve as a member of the Council only for the remainder
of the term during which such vacancy occurred.
                 (2) In the event of a vacancy in the Office of Mayor, and if the Chairman becomes a
candidate for the Office of Mayor to fill such vacancy, the Office of Chairman shall be deemed
vacant as of the date of the filing of his candidacy. In the event of a vacancy in the Council of a
member elected at large, other than a vacancy in the Office of Chairman, who is affiliated with a
political party, the central committee of such political party shall appoint a person to fill such
vacancy, until the Board of Elections and Ethics [Board of Elections] can hold a special election to
fill such vacancy, and such special election shall be held on the Tuesday occurring at least 70 days
and not more than 174 days after the date on which such vacancy occurs which the Board of
Elections determines, based on a totality of the circumstances, taking into account, inter alia,
cultural and religious holidays and the administrability of the election, will provide the opportunity
for the greatest level of voter participation. The person appointed to fill such vacancy shall take
office on the date of his appointment and shall serve as a member of the Council until the day on
which the Board certifies the election of the member elected to fill such vacancy in either a special
election or a general election. The person elected as a member to fill such a vacancy on the Council
shall take office on the day on which the Board of Elections and Ethics [Board of Elections]
certifies his election, and shall serve as a member of the Council only for the remainder of the term
during which such vacancy occurred. With respect to a vacancy on the Council of a member
elected at large who is not affiliated with any political party, the Council shall appoint a similarly
non-affiliated person to fill such vacancy until such vacancy can be filled in a special election in
the manner prescribed in this paragraph. Such person appointed by the Council shall take office
and serve as a member at the same time and for the same term as a member appointed by a central
committee of a political party.
                 (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, at no time shall there be
more than three members (including the Chairman) serving at large on the Council who are

which may by order require such person to appear and give or produce testimony or books, papers,
or other evidence, bearing upon the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order may

issued prior to October 1, 1996, for the financing of Department of Public Works, Water and
Sewer Utility Administration capital projects) and such Treasury loans;
                         (C) Determine the amount of principal and interest to be paid during each
fiscal year over the term of the proposed general obligation bond or such Treasury loan to be
issued; and

and (C) [of this paragraph] exceeds the amount determined under subparagraph (A) [of this
paragraph], then the proposed general obligation bond or such Treasury loan in subparagraph (C)
[of this paragraph] cannot be issued.

any budget which would result in expenditures being made by the District government, during any
fiscal year, in excess of all resources which the Mayor estimates will be available from all funds
available to the District for such fiscal year. The budget shall identify any tax increases which shall
be required in order to balance the budget as submitted. The Council shall be required to adopt
such tax increases to the extent its budget is approved.
         (d) Except as provided in subsection (f) [of this section], the Mayor shall not forward to
the President for submission to Congress a budget which is not balanced according to the provision

highly privileged (except that it may not be made after the Committee has reported a resolution
with respect to the same action), and debate thereon shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, to be

disagreed to.
         (i) Motions to postpone made with respect to the discharge from Committee or the
consideration of a resolution, and motions to proceed to the consideration of other business, shall
be decided without debate.
